<p align="center"> dni if ur a proshipper, friends with proshippers, friends of friends of friends etc. i do NOT want to be connected to proshippers sorry! dont expect me not to block you jus cs ur a "nice proshipper" cs i dont care. YES i will still block you if you sit or dont sit at the protree ðŸ¤£ not sitting at the protree doesnt make u any less weirder, ur still weird if u proship cs what... i dont care if u do it as a coping mechanism,, its mostly js an excuse cs hello?? that doesnt make u feel any better yeah ummm.. js dont interact with me if ur connected to proshippers AND if ur a proshipper. YES this also includes darkshippers i dont care. it DOES affect reality in everyway, u cant change my mind. "but im not a proshipper or a dakrshipper, just friends with one.. how is that bad!" well mister oblivious ur tolerating their weird fantasies so um..? i dont get how u people enjoy shipping minors x adults, abuser x victim, etc. that is DISGUSTING! rightt.. i will unfriend u if u have a tiny connection to proshippers so umm yeah! theres alot of ways to cope instead of proshipping.. find a better coping mechanism. i will still unfriend you if ur a close friend thats a proshipper or connected to them sorry.. ok whaetever thats enough for u all to understand that i dont want any connection to proshippers/darkshippers </p>
